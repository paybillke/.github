# Paybill

**Paybill** is a Kenya-based technology company building **critical financial and regulatory systems for the African market**.

We design and develop infrastructure that powers **tax compliance, payments, banking, and commerce**, with a strong focus on **local regulations, reliability, and long-term scalability**.

Our work spans both **public-sector compliance systems** and **private-sector financial platforms**, built to operate in real African environments—not idealized ones.

## 🧭 Our Focus

We build systems that sit at the **core of business and government operations**, including:

* **Tax & Compliance Systems**

  * eTIMS (Kenya)
  * EFRIS (Uganda)
  * Other electronic invoicing & tax authority integrations
* **Point of Sale (POS) Systems**

  * Retail, hospitality, and enterprise-grade POS
  * Offline-first, high-availability designs
* **Core Banking & Financial Platforms**

  * Ledger systems
  * Account management
  * Transaction processing
* **Mobile Money & Payments**

  * M-Pesa and regional mobile money integrations
  * Payment gateways and reconciliation systems
* **Enterprise & Government Integrations**

  * Secure APIs
  * Reporting pipelines
  * Audit-ready architectures

## 🧠 Principles We Build By

* **Regulation-first, not regulation-later**
  Compliance is designed in from day one.
* **Clarity over cleverness**
  Systems should be understandable by humans, not just machines.
* **Reliability beats novelty**
  If it handles money, uptime and correctness come first.
* **Local context matters**
  Network instability, regulation changes, and scale realities are first-class concerns.
* **Long-term maintainability**
  We optimize for systems that still make sense years from now.

We don’t build *magic*.
We build **systems you can reason about**.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

Our stack is chosen for **stability, clarity, and operational control**:

* **TypeScript**, **PHP** (core languages)
* **Terraform** (infrastructure orchestration)
* **Relational databases** (schema-first design)
* **Cloud-agnostic architecture**
* **Explicit ACL & policy models**
* Event-driven and API-first designs where appropriate

We favor boring, proven tools—used well.
