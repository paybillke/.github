# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Thank you for helping us keep this project secure. To report a vulnerability:

**Please do not open GitHub issues or pull requests** to disclose vulnerabilities. Reporting publicly can expose the issue to malicious actors before it is resolved.

### How to Report

Security issues in this open-source project can be safely reported through **[Paybill's Vulnerability Disclosure and Reward Program](https://paybill.ke/docs/en/security/#disclosure-and-reward-program)**.

Our security team will triage your report and respond based on the potential impact to Paybill users and systems. We appreciate your responsible disclosure and your contribution to a safer project for everyone.
